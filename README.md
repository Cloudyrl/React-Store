# React Store
React Ecommerce site made using react hooks, stripe as the payment processing platform and strapi for the api. 

Demo: https://vintage-clothing-store.netlify.app

The strapi api runs on a heroku free dyno, so it is possible that the server is sleeping when the app is making the first api call to fetch the products. It should't take more than 30 sec for it to wake up.
